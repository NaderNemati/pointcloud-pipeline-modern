# pointcloud-pipeline-modern




## Method. 

We build an end-to-end LiDAR pipeline that is laptop-friendly and modernized for real scenes. We use range-adaptive downsampling (finer near, coarser far), robust ground segmentation (Cloth Simulation Filter by default; optional Patchwork++ for multi-level ground), HDBSCAN clustering (better than a single-Îµ DBSCAN on varying densities), and PCA-based oriented boxes. For visuals, we render off-screen with Open3D using MSAA/TAA and ACES tone-mapping to produce high-quality MP4/GIFs. Dataset-wise, we run on MulRan ParkingLot (Ouster LiDAR, .bin same as KITTI) and optionally SemanticKITTI if you want labels.
